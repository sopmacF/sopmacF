### Bom dia ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a postdoc and deputy professor at [RheinMain University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-rm.de/en/), Wiesbaden, Germany.

In September 2023, I finished my PhD at the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/dis/), Nijmegen, The Netherlands under the supervision of [Peter Schwabe](https://cryptojedi.org/peter/index.shtml) and [Steffen Reith](https://www.hs-rm.de/de/hochschule/personen/reith-steffen/). My dissertation on "Isogeny-based key agreement" is available [here](https://www.sopmac.de/thesis).

My current research focus is on post-quantum and [high-assurance](https://formosa-crypto.org/) cryptography.
