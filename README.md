### Bom dia ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an external PhD candidate at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/dis/), Nijmegen, The Netherlands, under the supervision of [Peter Schwabe](https://cryptojedi.org/peter/index.shtml) and [Steffen Reith](https://www.hs-rm.de/de/hochschule/personen/reith-steffen/). Iâ€™m also lecturer and researcher at the [RheinMain University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-rm.de/en/), Wiesbaden, Germany.
My current research focus is on applied post-quantum cryptography.

Previously, I was at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/), Bochum, Germany.

I'm part of the small but nice [MAYO team](https://pqmayo.org/) working on a submission to the [NIST PQC call for additional digital signature schemes](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/pqc-dig-sig).

Iâ€™m also proud being part of [criptolatino.org](https://www.criptolatino.org/). We aim to help reducing the bridge between Latin America and the international cryptography community.
